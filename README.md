# SPACEX-DATA-SCRAPPING-IN-THE-IBM-WATSON-STUDIO
In this project, data involving lauches of SpaceX rockets was scrapped from a SpaceX website and wrangled and formatted for further processing

The web scrapping project was done in the IBM Watson studio. However there were challenges encountered in trying to push the project directly into github. IBM allows intergrations with github. In this case persistent problems were encountered forcing me to just provide a link to the project

The link is therefore provided below
